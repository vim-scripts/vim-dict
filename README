vim-dict

vim-dict is a dict client. It uses curl to connect to dict servers, so make sure you have curl installed.

The most recent version can be found on github: https://github.com/szw/vim-dict

Usage

To lookup a word (or words) in the dictionary use Dict command:

:Dict hello
:Dict start up

The Dict command uses hosts and databases defined in the g:dict_hosts global list. By default it is set to [["dict.org", ["all"]]] (the format will be explained a bit later).

Dict command can use a current word under the cursor. Just move the cursor to a word and type in the command line:

:Dict

You can also select words in the visual mode with help of the DictSelection command:

:DictSelection

Configuration

There are just a few global variables (options) you may set in the .vimrc file.

    g:dict_hosts

    The most important one is a list g:dict_hosts mentioned earlier. It combines hosts/databases used by vim-dict. The list entries are lists themselves and share the following format:

    ["host_name", ["database1", "database2", ...]]

    The sample extract from someone's ~/.vimrc file could look like this:

    let g:dict_hosts = [
        \["dict.org", ["all"]],
        \["dict.mova.org", ["slovnyk_en-pl", "slovnyk_pl-en"]]
    \]

    Moreover vim-dict can help you figure out what databases are available on your servers. There is a special command for this:

    :DictShowDb

    You can even open your .vimrc and provide some host urls only:

    let g:dict_hosts = [
        \["dict.org", []],
        \["dict.mova.org", []]
    \]

    Then save and reload .vimrc, perform DictShowDb and yank-paste the databases you want :).

    The list of DICT servers can be found on the internet, e.g. here.

    g:dict_leave_pw

    If set to 1 vim-dict leaves the preview window (the focus remains on the current window). By default it is set to 0.

    Example:

    let g:dict_leave_pw = 0

    g:dict_curl_command

    This variable holds the curl command to be fired by Dict function. You will find it handy if curl is not on your $PATH environment variable. By default it is set to "curl".

    Example:

    let g:dict_curl_command = "curl"

    g:dict_curl_options

    Sometimes you might want to add additional options to the curl invocation, e.g. additonal proxy settings. By default it defines only the connection timeout. Notice, the option -s (silent) is always present regardless of this variable.

    Example:

    let g:dict_curl_options = "--connect-timeout 30"
